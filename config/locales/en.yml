      It’s been eight years since we launched our sister site – HODINKEE – as a living, breathing love
      letter to the mechanical watches that we all admire so much.
      <br><br>
      Since then, what started as a personal project has turned into the leading voice in timepieces and the world 
      in which they live. Our team of writers, photographers, and designers have travelled the globe in pursuit of 
      not only the most interesting watches, but also the people who collect them, curate them, and most importantly, 
      make them.
      <br><br>
      Along the way, we picked up an eye for the design and quality that you only find in products made 
      the old fashioned way. The HODINKEE Shop is here to bring you what we’ve found in our travels – nothing 
      but products designed in detail, crafted with care, meant to last, and worn by all of us on the team.
      We hope you enjoy what you’ll find in the HODINKEE Shop as much as we do.

      Bob's Watches is the World's First and only Pre-Owned Rolex Exchange where consumers can buy, sell,
      and trade vintage and used Rolex watches at true fair market value. We openly publish the current buy and sell 
      values for each Rolex model allowing us to serve as an online marketplace for buyers and sellers looking, 
      quite simply, to get the best deal.
      <br><br>
      Unlike other companies, we specialize in used Rolex watches, including pre-owned, vintage and antique timepieces, 
      and pride ourselves in obtaining the very best results possible for our customers. Our business philosophy is built 
      on trust and integrity and in a very short time we have become the leading online destination for used Rolex watches 
      and vintage Rolex expertise. And unlike other online watch companies, Bob’s carries an actual inventory of watches. 
      Every watch on our site is in stock ready for sale. For more information about Bob's Watches, see our Wikipedia page.

      Like many ideas, this one began over lunch. After hearing a friend lament his watch-selling
      experience involving countless hours in the car, sketchy parking lot invitations, and one foreign prince scam, 
      our CEO and Founder, Hamilton Powell, knew there had to be a better way to transact in this space. 
      So, after a ton of research, Crown & Caliber began as a seller’s platform. It then evolved, as all good things do, 
      into a place where you could buy and sell with ease. Now, we carry 40 plus brands, own every watch on our site and 
      complete tens of thousands of transactions each year.
